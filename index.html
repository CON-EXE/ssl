                    <h1>Web Security</h1>

                    <h2>What is SSL?</h2>
                    <p>
                        SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is like a digital 
                        security guard for websites. It creates a secure 
                        connection between your web browser and the website, making sure 
                        any information you send (like passwords or credit card numbers) 
                        is encrypted and protected from eavesdroppers.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What is TLS?</h2>
                    <p>
                        TLS, or Transport Layer Security, is like an upgraded version of SSL. 
                        It serves the same purpose: protecting the information you send over 
                        the internet by encrypting it so that only the intended recipient 
                        can read it. This helps keep your data safe from hackers or anyone 
                        trying to eavesdrop.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How can you tell if a web page is secure?</h2>
                    <p>
                        To check if a webpage is secure, look for a padlock icon in the address 
                        bar of your web browser. This icon indicates that the website is using 
                        SSL or TLS to encrypt your data. Also, the website address should start 
                        with "https://" instead of just "http://". The "s" stands for "secure," 
                        meaning your connection to the site is encrypted and safer from potential 
                        eavesdroppers.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What does it mean to be secure?</h2>
                    <p>
                        In terms of web security, being secure means protecting your data and 
                        online activities from threats like hackers, malware, and unauthorized access. 
                        A secure website ensures that any information you share, such as passwords 
                        or credit card details, is encrypted so that it can't be easily intercepted 
                        or tampered with. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Why are SSL and TLS important?</h2>
                    <p>
                        SSL and TLS are vital for web security because they protect your data during 
                        transmission. They encrypt the information exchanged between your device and 
                        the website's server, making it difficult for hackers to intercept or tamper 
                        with it. This encryption ensures that sensitive information like passwords, 
                        credit card details, and personal data remain confidential.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What is encryption?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Encryption is like a secret code for your data. It transforms readable 
                        information, like text or numbers, into a scrambled, unreadable format. 
                        Only someone with the right "key" can decode it and understand the 
                        original message. This process keeps your sensitive information, such 
                        as passwords and credit card numbers, safe from unauthorized access. 
                        It's widely used in online communications, banking, and many other areas 
                        to ensure that your data stays private and secure, even if it gets 
                        intercepted by hackers.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What is an SSL certificate authority?</h2>
                    <p class="bottom">
                        An SSL Certificate Authority (CA) is like a trusted digital notary. 
                        When a website wants to prove it's secure and safe to visit, it 
                        gets an SSL certificate from a CA. The CA checks the website's 
                        identity to make sure it's legitimate. Once the website passes 
                        this check, the CA issues a certificate. This certificate lets 
                        the website create secure connections with visitors, keeping their 
                        data private and protected from hackers. In short, the CA verifies 
                        the website's identity and helps keep your online interactions safe.
